        <h1>Dual-Purpose </h1> 
        <p>Dual-purpose farm animals are those that are bred and raised for two purposes, such as for both meat and milk production. These animals can provide a valuable source of income for farmers and ranchers, as they can be used for their meat, milk, and other products. Examples of dual-purpose farm animals include sheep, goats, and cattle. These animals are typically hardy and adaptable, able to thrive in a variety of environments and climates. They are also known for their strong mothering instincts, which make them good mothers and help to ensure that their offspring are healthy and well-fed. Dual-purpose farm animals are an
           important resource for farmers and ranchers, providing both meat and milk, which can be sold for income</p>

         <article class="galla">
            <p> They tolerate heat and drought and have great teeth 
                (which means they rarely need to be culled
              due to worn-down chompers). The goats also produce a
               lot of nutritious milk and mature more quickly </p>
